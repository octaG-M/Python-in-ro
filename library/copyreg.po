"The :mod:`copyreg` module offers a way to define functions used while "
"pickling specific objects.  The :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`copy` modules use"
" those functions when pickling/copying those objects.  The module "
"provides configuration information about object constructors which are "
"not classes. Such constructors may be factory functions or class "
"instances."

"Declares *object* to be a valid constructor.  If *object* is not callable"
" (and hence not valid as a constructor), raises :exc:`TypeError`."

"Declares that *function* should be used as a \"reduction\" function for "
"objects of type *type*.  *function* must return either a string or a "
"tuple containing between two and six elements. See the "
":attr:`~pickle.Pickler.dispatch_table` for more details on the interface "
"of *function*."
